## Using the Dev Container

If you install [ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop), you will be able to run your code inside a Linux container (kind of like a virtual machine, but faster). Also, you will get static analyzers, code formatters and useful extensions installed out of the box! It is a great option to get started with C++ quickly.

(Unfortunately, if you want to do GUI applications they don't work well from within a container and you might have to do a proper setup on your own desktop instead. But for simple command-line applications this works amazingly well!)

NB: the container might take a while to build the first time.
